# CodingChallenge3

Objective: This exercise will test your knowledge of loops and arrays by enhancing your theoretical app with a feature that handles user reviews, calculates statistics, and performs actions based on review data.

Step 1: Copy Over Coding Challenge Solution 2 to a new Swift file in a separate repository named "Coding Challenge Solution 3".

Step 2: Implement the following features in your new file:

**Part 1: Handling User Reviews**
Create an Array of Reviews:
- Declare an array userReviews to store individual review ratings (Double). Assume ratings are between 1.0 to 5.0.
- Assign initial values to this array representing past user reviews.

Calculate Average Rating:
- Use a for loop to iterate through the userReviews array and calculate the average rating.
- Print the average rating with descriptive text.


Part 2: Performing Actions Based on Review Data
Count Reviews by Rating:

Use a for loop to count how many reviews fall into different rating categories:
Excellent (4.5 to 5.0)
Good (3.5 to 4.4)
Average (2.5 to 3.4)
Poor (1.0 to 2.4)
Print the count of reviews in each category with descriptive text.
